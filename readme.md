<b5>Personal Feelings </b5>
- Don't learn AWS without Terraform.
- Every thing in AWS is a cost and needs to be managed.
- Each configuration in AWS; they have your CREDIT CARD, charges will go nuts.
<br>

There is terms that in AWS/Cloud/DevOps that you will learn. <br>
- <b>Source of Truth:</b> a repository like this. <br>
- <b>Pipeline:</b> 2 or more scripts that work together and form a target environment. <br>
- <b>Ephemeral:</b> temporary and can vanish; a reoccuring thought of efficient managment or watch money disappear. <br>

Think of this as a journey and we are here on this together. <br>

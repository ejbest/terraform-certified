<b5>Personal Feelings </b5>
- Don't learn AWS without Terraform.
- Every thing in AWS is a cost and needs to be managed.
- In the above video; just setting up a simple server, takes 9 configurations in AWS.
- Each of the 9 configurations; has millions of settings combined.
- Each configuration in AWS; they have your CREDIT CARD, charges will go nuts.
<br>
- There is terms that in AWS/Cloud/DevOps that you will learn 
- - Source of Truth: a repository like this.
- - Pipeline: 2 or more scripts that work together and form a target environment 
- - Ephemeral: temporary and can vanish; a reoccuring thought of efficient managment or watch money disappear.  
- - Think of this as a journey and we are here on this together.

FYI - just covered “Terraform in 2 Hours”  


https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLB_c_ayRMo&t=5027s

this is something I can not recommend enough and the one that “I fail to stress the importance of” when learning AWS - this is great way to learn and break the ice with AWS and “controlling AWS”

Why control AWS; they have your CREDIT CARD and charges will go nuts; don’t believe me, let me know how that works out.

What did you change “everything is in the terraform code and was you need to tailor the settings, having the details in the code is mandatory 

Because Terraform dilemmas came up I am doing this and will get back on Kubernetes VERY SOON and I am going for that CKA

If you have not made focus here; please see I am doing this again, trust me on this - how is all otherwise ?
